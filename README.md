###### Gulp-foreach-swig
Using gulp-foreach and applying gulp-swig to each json file, pipeline them through one template and generate new .html files. Using gulp-rename to apply their json file names to the new html file names.

Run `npm install`
Compile files from json into html with `gulp default` It will generate "dist" folder with new html files inside.

Ignore sass and css file for now...
